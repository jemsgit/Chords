What is lying in the corner of the room
In complete mostly sacred silence?
Pale walls are hanging above
And I see myself in some
Strange picture of violence...

Me is clot of the thoughts and dreams
Me is everything it should seem
Me is crack of the century
Me is fake, me is joke, me is real!

My ceiling's cracking and we are apart
We knew it was end from the start
When you saw me in green light dress
Realizing it wasn't fate...

Me is clot of the thoughts and dreams
Me is everything it should seem
Me is crack of the century
Me is fake, me is joke, me is real!

My beautiful green backdoor lawn
We're making love till the dawn
It might be cold. I don't care...
I can see it as if I was there!!!

I Am a clot of the thoughts and dreams
I Am a everything it should seem
I Am a crack of the century
I Am fake, I Am joke, I Am real!
