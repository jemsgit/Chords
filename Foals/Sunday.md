[Verse 1]
D                 Am
Time has come and time is gone
C            G               D
Cities burn, we got youth to spend
            Am
And time to waste in love
   C              G
To live again, my friend
D                      Am
Through the flames and through the fire
C            G               D
Cities burn, we don't give a damn
              Am                    C
'Cause we got all our friends right here
G               D     Am    C   G
We got youth to spe - e  -  nd
 
 
[Chorus]
       D              Am
'Cause time away from me
          C                G                  D
Is what I need to clear my sight and clear my head
                Am                   C
I'm coming down over it, coming down over
            G
Coming down over
              D                      Am
I'll be right there, I'm coming down over it
            C     G
Coming down over again
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
D         Am
Oh, oh-oh-oh
C         G
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
D         Am
Oh, oh-oh-oh
C         G
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
 
 
[Verse 2]
     D               Am
When all is said and all is done
    C               G
Our fathers run and leave all the damage
        D
They've done behind
Am               C                 G
Left us with the blind leading the blind
    D                 Am
And time has come and time is done
C            G               D
Cities burn, we don't give a damn
              Am                    C
'Cause we got all our friends right here
G               D     Am    C   G
We got youth to spe - e  -  nd
 
 
[Chorus]
       D              Am
'Cause time away from me
          C                G                  D
Is what I need to clear my sight and clear my head
                Am                   C
I'm coming down over it, coming down over
            G
Coming down over
              D                      Am
I'll be right there, I'm coming down over it
            C     G
Coming down over again
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
         D     Am                C     G
Be right the - re, I'll be right the - re
D               Am                   C
Down I go, I'll scream, I'll go down again
          G               D
I feel my blood, I did my time
               Am                   C
I'm deep in my head, I'm deep in my way
               G
I'm deep in my soul
       D    Am
Here I go - o
              C     G
I'll be right the - re
 
D Am C G
 
 
[Bridge]
    D            Am           C            G
I'm over it now, over it now, over it, I'm over it
D        Am       C        G
Over it, over it, over it
      D                 Am
Going over it, over and over it
        C                 G
Finally over it, over it, over it
         D                 Am
Over and over it, over and over it
       C                 G
I mean over it, over and over it
D        Am       C
Over it, over and over it
         G
Over and over it
     D                           Am
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
     C                            G
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
     D                           Am
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
     C                            G
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
     D                            Am
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
     D
(The birds are all singing)
     Am
(The birds are all singing)
     C                            G
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
 
 
[Outro]
D              Am           C
Time away from me is what I need
            G                  D    Am
To clear my sight and clear my he - ad
         C    G
clear my he - ad
         D    Am  C   G
Clear my he - e - e - ad
         D    Am  C   G
Clear my he - e - e - ad
D         Am
Oh, oh-oh-oh
C         G
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
D         Am
Oh, oh-oh-oh
C         G
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
