[Verse 1]
Em           |D    C
All alone not by myself
Em              |D      C
Another girl bad for my health
Em                      |D       C
I've seen it all through someone else, and I
Em               |D      C
(Another girl bad for my health)
 
Em            |D    C
Celebrated but undisturbed
Em              |D      C
Serenaded by the terror bird
Em                       |D     C
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, oh
Em               |D      C    |Em
(Serenaded by the terror bird)
 
[Chorus]
      D            |A            E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
E   D             |A           E
Desecration is the smile on my face
E        D            |A           E
The love I made is the shape of my space
E  D        |A
My face, my face
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Em                  |D      C
Disintegrated by the rising sun
Em                    |D     C
A rolling black out of oblivion
Em                                 |D      C
And I'd like to think that I'm your number one, I'm
Em                     |D     C
(A rolling black out of oblivion)
 
Em                 |D        C
I wanna leave but I just get stuck
Em                     |D      C
A broken record runnin' low on luck
Em                        |D         C
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
Em                                |D      C     |Em
And I'm a (a broken record runnin' low on luck)
 
[Chorus]
      D           |A             E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
E   D             |A           E
Desecration is the smile on my face
E        D            |A           E
The love I made is the shape of my space
E  D        |A
My face, my face
 
[Bridge]
| C  G  | E    | C  G  | E    |
 
C            G
We could out all go down to
E
Malibu and make some noise
C                 G      E
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
C            G
We could all come up with
E
Something new to be destroyed
C               Em
We could all go down
 
[Instrumental]
| Em   | D  C  | Em   | D  C  |
 
[Verse]
Em                        |D      C
I love the feeling when it falls apart
Em                        |D        C
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Em                          |D      C
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
      Em                       |D        C     |Em
And I'm (Slow to finish but I'm quick to start)
 
[Chorus] (x2)
      D           |A             E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
E   D             |A           E
Desecration is the smile on my face
E        D            |A           E
The love I made is the shape of my space
E  D       |A
My face my face
